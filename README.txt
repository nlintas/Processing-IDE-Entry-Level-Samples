Detailed Description:
    Some samples used to learn the Processing IDE. Used for training for simulation games in the Processing IDE and then extending to game development in game engines (e.g. Godot). Follow the levels arithmetic order for a better understanding of the concepts and study closely how the Processing IDE works (https://processing.org/tutorials).

    * Training Topics *
    The training code is about 2D animations, traditional game development processes, physics programming and simulation creation.

Aims:
    • Organise training material in a more streamlined fashion
    • Share the training projects with the rest of the open-source community to help them too.
    • Allow for people to learn through tinkering existing projects.

How to run:
    - Open the main folder of each project in the Physics Processing IDE and click the run green arrow button.
